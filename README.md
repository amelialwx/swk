# Speak With Kindness

"Speak With Kindness" is a web-based project aimed at addressing and combating casual racism in Singapore. This project was initiated as a side project during my high school years dedicated to fostering a more inclusive and understanding community. This repo contains the preliminary mock site I designed for the project, showcasing the initial layout, user interface, and content themes focused on fostering conversations around racial understanding and kindness, while incorporating the unique nuances of Singaporean speech to resonate more deeply with the local audience.

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project comes from the observation that casual racism is often overlooked or unaddressed in Singapore. The project seeks to open up dialogues, spread awareness, and encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations about race and diversity.

## Features
**Awareness through blogging**: The website features a blog section where various topics related to racism and its impact on society are discussed. These blog posts aim to educate visitors and stimulate reflective discussions.

**Engaging visuals**: The site uses striking visuals and a user-friendly layout, incorporating distinctive elements of Singaporean speech, to effectively engage visitors and convey messages in a manner that genuinely connects with the local community.

**Contact and interaction**: A contact section allowing for visitors to reach out, share their stories, or ask questions, promoting interaction and community engagement.

## Technologies Used
**HTML/CSS**: The core structure of the website is built using HTML5 and styled with CSS3.

**JavaScript Libraries**: Including jQuery for enhanced interactivity and functionality.

**Google Fonts & Font Awesome**: For typography and iconography, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.

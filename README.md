# Speak With Kindness

"Speak With Kindness" is a web-based project aimed at addressing and combating casual racism in Singapore. This project was initiated as a side project during my high school years dedicated to fostering a more inclusive and understanding community. This repo contains the preliminary mock site I designed for the project, showcasing the initial layout, user interface, and content themes focused on fostering conversations around racial understanding and kindness, while incorporating the unique nuances of Singaporean speech to resonate more deeply with the local audience.

## Technologies Used
**HTML/CSS**: The core structure of the website is built using HTML5 and styled with CSS3.
